As mentioned in the question, the program takes name of two cities as the input and then runs the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to get the shortest path.
It returns the Path from source to the destination and the distance of shortest path.

#Test Case 1:
--------------

Enter city #1: Mandya
Enter city #2: Belgaum

Shortest route and distance: Mandya-Tumkur-Belgaum, 124.0 km

#Test Case 2:
-------------
Enter city #1: Mangalore
Enter city #2: Chickmagalur

Shortest route and distance: Mangalore-Mandya-Tumkur-Belgaum-Chickmagalur, 368.0 kms

#Test Case 3:
------------- 
Enter city #1: 
abc
Enter city #2: 
def
Please Enter the correct City Name!!

#Test case 4:
-------------
Enter city #1: 
1
Enter city #2: 
2
Please Enter the correct City Name!!

#Test Case 5:
-------------
Enter city #1: 
Chickmagalur
Enter city #2: 
Mysore

Shortest route and distance: Chickmagalur-Belgaum-Bangalore-Mysore, 198.0 kms

Note:

The path from Tumkur to Mandya is such that there are two routes, one is 65 and other one is 65.5, looks like the cycle is there by mmistake so I have omitted that path. Rest all the things are taken care of.
